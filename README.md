# Yii2 Angular 5 Starter <sup>basic</sup>

#### Quickly start developing web apps with Yii 2 Rest API and Angular 5 frontend..

A basic starter package to help developing MEAN stack application faster.

The default MEAN stack you get out of the box can work with either Angular or React and is built with the following technologies...

* [Yii2](http://www.yiiframework.com/)
* [Angular5](https://angular.io)

## Prerequisite Technologies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* [Node 8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* npm 5.x ( or yarn)

## Installation

Clone the repository from Github. 
This repository contains all the packages, modules and also a sample code base with User registration / login feature. Following the steps below will guide you to install the latest MEAN version.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/awsafanam/yii2-ng5.git  
cd mean-starter
composer update
npm install  
npm start
```
If all the packages and modules installed successfully, your default web browser will open and you can see the default MEAN application at `http://localhost:3000`. This is the default port unless you change that manually.
